# Sveltekit template

This is a very opinionated Sveltekit template. It's configured for my personal setup.

## Getting started

Use [degit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/degit) to copy the contents of this repo into your current directory. By using `degit`, you remove all git data and history.

```bash
pnpx degit nick-mazuk/sveltekit-template
```

Then install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Now, you should be able to do whatever you want.

```bash
pnpm dev #start development server
pnpm dev:open # start development server and open in new browser tab
pnpm build # create production build, by default uses vercel adapter
pnpm start # starts the production server

pnpm test # run tests
pnpm lint # format and lint everything
```
